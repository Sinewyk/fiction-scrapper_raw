# fiction-scrapper

Scrap something as html from anywhere as long as there's an adapter.
Add it to calibre for automatic epub converter or keep it as html, that's your choice.

# Install
Not yet on npm =D. You can make do by cloning this and stuff if you have the know how, but I want the refactor on observable & stuff before I publish for easy refactoring and requests

# adapters
  * http://www.wuxiaworld.com/ (Started from there because no way to download from there)

# TODO
  * Almost all the others are easy
  
# Tech todo:
Explode host config, one host per file,
A bit more type for those parser stuff
As always, started Promise based, so ... I can't keep track of the progress ... need to switch to Observables.
File input.
Implement the "whatever" filter so that I can do "whatever" I want before starting to download (pass through an age barrier or username/password attacher to following requests ?)
